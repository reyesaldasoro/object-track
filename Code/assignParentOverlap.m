% assignParentLoop  routine that assigns parent-child relationship (based 
%     on overlapping between nodes) for the tracking process.
%
%     INPUT 
%         firstNetwork: a matrix that contains one row **per object** 
%             segmented. Columns correspond to:
%               *1,2,3      - X, Y, Z for each object
%               *4          - distance to closest neighbour
%               *5          - frame
%               *10         - area of object
%     OUTPUT
%         firstNetwork: a copy of the firstNetwork matrix containing 
%             new additional information about the parent-child 
%             relationship of the nodes in firstNetwork. Columns 6-ID,
%             7-parent and 8-child are completed here.
