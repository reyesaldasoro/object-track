%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% distanceElements  obtains distance between a series of elements, it returns 
%     the minimum distance from the element to the neighbours, i.e. the 
%     distance to the closest neighbour
%
%       INPUT
%         dataIn:               An matrix of x,y,z positions or a 2D BW image.
%       OUTPUT
%         miuD:                 Distance to other points as integer (ceil)
%         distanceBetPoints:    Distance to other points
%         numNeighboursAtDist:  Count of neighbours at certain distance,
%                               number is coded.
%         comDistance:          Distance to closest neighbour
%         distToDisappearing:   Distance to closest disappearing neighbour
%         distToAppearing:      Distance to closest appearing neighbour
