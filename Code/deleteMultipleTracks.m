% deleteMultipleTracks delete all the tracks that are below a certain distance
%      and calls removeOneTrack for every candidate
%       Tasks:
%           1 pass nodes from trackTwo to trackOne
%           2 remove trackTwo from finalNetwork
%           3 recalculate  effectiveTracks effectiveDistance x  explorationNetwork, translationNetwork, inWoundNetwork, inWound,
%           4 reassign track assignment in nodeNetwork
%           5 remove all calculations from distanceNetwork (recalculate?)
%
%       INPUT
%         handles:                  handles struct
%         woundRegion:              wound region (to recalculate metrics)
%         maxDistanceConsidered:    above the maximum distance the pair is discarded
%         minDistanceConsidered:    below the minimum distance the pair is discarded
%         minSeparationTwin:        in case one track may be assigned as child to two
%                                   candidates, only assign if one is closer to the
%                                   child by this distance (default is to discard
%                                   both options and be done manually)
%
%       OUTPUT
%         handles:                  new handles struct with the tracks merged
