%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% joinMultipleTracks analyses all tracks of handles, selects those that can be merged
%     under certain criteria and calls joinTwoTracks for every pair of candidates
%       Tasks:
%           1 measures distance from each track to upper tracks 
%           2 calculate distances if not provided by the user
%           3 discard pairs that do not satisfy criteria
%           4 call pairs into joinTwoTracks
%
%       INPUT
%         handles:                  handles struct
%         woundRegion:              wound region (to recalculate metrics)
%         maxDistanceConsidered:    above the maximum distance the pair is discarded
%         minDistanceConsidered:    below the minimum distance the pair is discarded
%         minSeparationTwin:        in case one track may be assigned as child to two
%                                   candidates, only assign if one is closer to the
%                                   child by this distance (default is to discard
%                                   both options and be done manually)
%
%       OUTPUT
%         handles:                  new handles struct with the tracks merged
